This folder contains data related to software reverse engineering of OS7 and tenatively, one game, Donkey Kong 16K.

The files are in Ghidra's project format, and can be imported as a project so that you can analyze the results.

Still to be done:

* Donkey Kong analysis of object types
* Overall addition of comments from OS7 listing and other sources
* lots more I can't think on, because I am still drinking my coffee.
